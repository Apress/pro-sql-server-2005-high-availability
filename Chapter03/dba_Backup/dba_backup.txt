This stored procedure allows you to create backups all using one command. You do not
need to worry about different commands for full, differential, or transaction log
backups. You can modify this procedure, but it is a good example to show you how
scripting common tasks can simplify your database management.

This stored procedure has three parameters:
@db_name - this is the name of the database to back up; encased in single quotes
@backup_dir - this is the directory where the database will be made; encased in single quotes
@backup_type - this is the type of backup that will be generated. Valid values:			
	1 = full backup
	2 = differential backup
	3 = transaction log backup

A full backup will get an extension of .bak, a differential backup will have an
extension of .dif, and a transacion log backup will have a file extension of .trn.

In the directory you specify, your backup will be created with the following naming 
convention:
INSTANCENAME_DATABASENAME_BACKUPTYPE_BACKUPSTARTTIME.EXTENSION

For example:
LS-MIRROR-1_ConsolidateTo2005_TLOG_080428132704.trn

is a transaction log backup file from the database ConsolitdateTo2005
from instance LS-MIRROR-1. The backup file was started on April 28, 2008
at 1:27:04 PM.


Below is an example that will back up a transaction log:
exec dba_backup
	@db_name = 'ConsolidateTo2005',
	@backup_dir = 'C:\SQL Backups\ConsolidateTo2005'
	@backup_type = 3
